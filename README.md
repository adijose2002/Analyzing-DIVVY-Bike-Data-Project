# Analyzing-DIVVY-Bike-Data-Project
Project Description: My program is going to input 2 types of data: stations in the
DIVVY system, and bike trips that riders have taken on a DIVVY bike.
My program starts by prompting and inputting the name of the
stations file from the keyboard, and then prompting and inputting the
name of the bike trips file from the keyboard. If either file cannot be
opened, the program should output an error message (including the
filename) and stop.
